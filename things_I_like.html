            <p>
            The long-awaited series where I try to review every library at UCL (that they will let me into).
            </p>
<p><br>  
<span class= "title" style= "font-size:100%; font-weight: 600; color:#2b1e1c">IOE Library <i>(02/07/2023)</i>  </span>    
<br> <br> One of the first libraries I visited at UCL, and the first one I wrote anything down for. IOE is one of the best education departments in the world (and <i>the</i> best according to a few rankings), so I felt like the library was going to be pretty good.
<br> <br> The library entrance was tucked away from the main door: you need to go through a narrow corridor with plasterboard white walls since there's some construction going on. Since this was one of the first libraries I visited, and knowing there are so many libraries at UCL, I expected the IOE library to be very small. But once I made it thought that sketch corridor, I entered into a lovely space that reminded me of a really nice local library if it had an insane amount of money for renovation. The library itself is three stories tall, coloured with light woods, white, grey-blue metal shelving and a richer blue signage. There are very large windows so there is lots of light. There are plants on the main floor and trees are visible through the outward facing windows which look onto a park.
<br> <br> I found the atmosphere really calming, though not insanely laid back. It felt like the librarians had worked really hard to make space feel calming. It's hard to describe but definitely a really great space to work in. 
<br> <br> It’s also really close to something that’s like the local shops of this area, so it is super easy to go out and get food.
</p>

<span class= "title" style= "font-size:100%; font-weight: 600; color:#2b1e1c">Main Library <i>(02/07/2023)</i>  </span>    
<br><br>This library is right inside the big neo-classical building that you see on a lot of UCL promotional stuff. It looks (and smells) like a library that has been around for a very long time. It is dusty and musty and I love it, even if it has made convinced I am allergic to dust (I mean I was pretty sure before but I think my sniffles in here settle it).
<br><br>There is one long central corridor that goes across the width of the building, which branches off into lots of different little library rooms and study areas. The main corridor itself is also lined with books on art, philosophy, history. Massive old-money humanities student energy coming from the Main Library.
<br><br>In the middle of the long central corridor, there’s this big opening, with a large sculpture, but otherwise the rooves are fairly low and everything is made of a dark, creakier wood. Some of the rooms with stairs going up and many branches remind me of the Weasley’s house in the Harry Potter movies. The whole library feels like its own little labyrinth- it seems fairly small at first, but keeps branching off in different directions through lots of different little corridors. It is really really beautiful, but not at all in the same way that some of the more modern libraries at UCL are.
<br><br>I studied here in the afternoon, and the light coming though the window where I was sitting was really nice. I don’t think it has any air conditioning thought (at least it wasn’t on when I was there) so it felt a bit stuffy. It seems like the perfect library for days when it’s cooler and there aren’t that many people, but I can imagine it being a hot and sweaty mess when there are lots of people and it’s a hotter day.

<span class= "title" style= "font-size:100%; font-weight: 600; color:#2b1e1c">Language and Speech Science Library <i>(03/07/2023)</i></span>           
<br><br>Honestly I’m really biased toward this one because it is the library in the building where my class is, and it is filled with books I am interested by.
<br><br>It is fairly far away from the main part of the campus, which would make me think that it isn’t as busy during the semester. At the same time though, there are regularly people in here even during the break and it is quite small.
<br><br>Quite a small library, but I am a sucker for round windows and attic rooms, so honestly I really like the vibe of the space. There are nice desks and chairs, and it doesn’t feel dirty at all. There also isn’t a strong smell of dust and old paper that comes with a lot of libraries, which could be good or bad depending on the kind of person you are I think.

<span class= "title" style= "font-size:100%; font-weight: 600; color:#2b1e1c">Student Centre <i>(04/07/2023)</i></span>            
<br><br> This is definitely the place that people go when they want to study with their friends. There are lots of social study areas, the building has multiple floors and it is all quite open. It isn’t a library per se, but does have all of the study space that most people use a library for, so functionally it is fairly similar. There is a café inside the building (and a second one outside which is also really close to the Main Library actually), so getting food isn’t an issue at all. Apparently there is a specific kind of coffee that they only sell in the UCL student centre. This is also where Jeremy Bentham’s auto icon is held, so if not having a preserved corpse where you study is a deal breaker this is the one. Aesthetically it is just like Marie Reay at ANU, but with more attitude (concrete).
<br><br> It is as far as I know the only study-space in UCL that is open 24-hours, which is really good for studying in the morning since the earliest other libraries here tend to open at 8:45am. So if you are an early morning studier, or an extremely late night studier then this is really the only option. 
<br><br> The openness means it all can get really noisy during the day, so probably more of a social space if you’re here during peak times. But for me studying in the morning when most students are on break it is really nice.

<span class= "title" style= "font-size:100%; font-weight: 600; color:#2b1e1c">UCL School of Slavonic and East European Studies Library <i>(05/07/2023)</i></span>            
 <br><br>I likee look of this building from the outside: it has these big black bars Would feel way more enclosed without the big glass space going right through the middle of the building. Three of the four walls look into other buildings with only a little bit of light tricling through
 <br><br>Light is still definitely an issue here, as when it became overcast the whole building started to look a little grim
 <br><br>I have never seen so many books in Polish in a single place in my entire life which was interesting. It makes me really want to study Polish more
 <br><br>There is a lot of black and grey metal, beige carpets and wall, glass column
 <br><br>The fabric of the chairs is the same colour as in the IOE library
 <br><br>Does not seems like a very large building at first, but there are four floors of books, with desks sprinkled in between. There was plenty of sitting space when I was there, but I’m not too sure how many desks there are in total, since they seem to be spread around each floor. The building also includes an ominous basement library level with red carpet and darker wood. It seemed mustier than the rest of the building at first but was actually pretty nice.
 <br><br>Academic offices line the outer walls of most of the floors, but there are two extra floors at the top of the building where I’m guessing most of the department is.
 <br><br>There is also a sign in here saying don’t leave food out or the rats will eat it. But also I literally say a rat scurry under a vending machine in the basement of IOE so they’re probably in all of the UCL buildings somewhere. If anything that sign makes this library better than the others for being so conscious of the issue.
